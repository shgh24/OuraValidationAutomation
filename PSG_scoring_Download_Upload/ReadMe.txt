How to automate usage of the Usleep API:


Use in windows:


Here's how you can run the script using Git Bash:

1.	Install Git for Windows from the official website: https://git-scm.com/download/win if your computer does not have git.

2.	Open Git Bash by typing "git bash" into the Start menu and selecting the "Git Bash" program.

3.	Run the script using the bash command followed by the name of your script. For example, if your script is called Usleep_upload.sh, you can type:

	Usleep_upload.sh

4.	Before running the script you should change these 2 lines in the Usleep_upload.sh files, every 12 hours the API token expires and you should get a new API key from Usleep Website, change the USLEEP_API_TOKEN with the new API token, if you change the folder that data are saved you have to change the path after cd /path/to/EDF Data folder/

cd C:/Users/SCL/Desktop/TestUsleep/
export USLEEP_API_TOKEN=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NzgzNzk3NTksImlhdCI6MTY3ODMzNjU1OswibmJmIjoxNjc4MzM2NTU5LCJpZGVudGl0eSI6ImUwY2RlM2IyYzUxOSJ9.hhiQ3u5SQb6SbTtn2bSkDpdE-rTOEKj-gLkObt80Yxk
